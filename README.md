# Overview

An IMDB scraper built with Vanilla Javascript and Express. It scrapes IMDB to show general search results as well as data from a specific movie page. Node fetch was used to make the request and Cheerio was used to parse it. Caching was implemented as well. I deployed the final project to [_now_](https://zeit.co/now). You can see the final project [here](https://my-imdb-scraper.now.sh/).

I also made a fronted UI for it to view it all cleanly. It makes requests to this api and display all the search data as well as movie page data. I used Bootstrap for styling and also deployed it using [_now_](https://zeit.co/now). You can see that [here](https://imdb-search.now.sh/).
